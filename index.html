		<h2>About Me</h2>

			<img src="assets/images/ph200x200.png">

			<p>I am currently working as a CNC Machinist/Programmer.  I have been in the machining industry for 4 years.  However, I realized that it was not where my heart was.  Computer Science and programming has always been a passion of mine.  So in hopes of taking that passion to the next step, I enrolled in The Coding Boot Camp through The University of Utah Professional Education.  When I am not working, I am traveling, playing music (guitar), or playing video games.
